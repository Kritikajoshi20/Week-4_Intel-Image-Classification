This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify natural scene images from the Intel Image Classification dataset. The goal is to accurately categorize images into six distinct classesâ€”buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street by leveraging deep learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and visualization of results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
